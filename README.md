# Legal Document Analyzer üìö‚öñÔ∏è
Project Overview
This Legal Document Analyzer is a proof-of-concept NLP project demonstrating the potential of transformers for legal document summarization. While the full vision requires extensive computational resources, this implementation serves as a foundational exploration of applying advanced machine learning techniques to legal text processing.

## ü§ó Hugging Face Hosted Model

---


## üöÄ Demo

You can directly test the model using the following code:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="sanatann/legal-summarizer-bart")

text = "Your long legal document here..."

summary = summarizer(text)

print(summary)
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The project uses a comprehensive legal document dataset from Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/7152317), containing:

Indian Legal Abstracts (IN-Abs)
Indian Legal Extendeds (IN-Ext)
UK Legal Abstracts (UK-Abs)
